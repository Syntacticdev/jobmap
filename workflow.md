# Phase 1: Core API & Database

##### ✅ Skills: REST API, DB schema design, query optimization.
- Set up Express + PostgreSQL/MongoDB.
- Implement basic CRUD (Users, Jobs, Applications).
- Add authentication (JWT/Session).
- Optimize queries with indexes (search jobs by category, paginate results).

# Phase 2: Queue System
##### ✅ Skills: Queues, retries, async background processing.
- Client post a job
- Job Saved to a DB
- Queue triggered → send notifications to matching freelancers
- Cron runs daily → mark expired jobs
- Add caching with Redis for trending jobs.

# Phase 3: Cron Jobs & Scheduling
##### ✅ Skills: Scheduling, system automation.
- Add cron job to expire jobs after 30 days.
- Add weekly summary cron (send email report to clients).
- Add monthly invoicing cron (queue payment tasks).

# Phase 4: Optimization Layer
##### ✅ Skills: Cache, DB optimization, transactions.
- Add caching with Redis for trending jobs.
- Write optimized DB queries (e.g., job recommendations by skills).
- Implement transactions (payment + job completion).


# Phase 5: Scalability & Testing
##### ✅ Skills: Production readiness, testing, DevOps basics.
- Add rate limiting & logging (Winston or Pino).
- Write unit + integration tests (Jest, Supertest).
- Dockerize API + Redis + DB.
- Explore horizontal scaling with queues.

# Phase 6 (Optional Advanced)
- Add GraphQL endpoint for flexible queries.
- Add WebSocket/Socket.io for real-time notifications.
- Explore microservices split (Payments, Notifications, Jobs as separate services).
